## 10/8/2025 - Grounded -> Blueprint! Research and fixing things  

yippee grounded became blueprint!!

Looked for nfc/rfid modules. My original idea was to have a whole antenna board incorporating my own implementation of PN532 and other antennas and IR transcievers or something, but apparently thats kind of hard.. New idea is to still have an antenna board mounted under the main board but the NFC part be a separate 'cutout' in the board to house a premade module (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006236546207.html)

Also, added buttons and changed all my resisotrs to 0603 (i had some through-hole ones accidentally), going to do that for my capacitors next at some point.

TODO:
- SD card
- sub-ghz
- IR
- wifi/bluetooth???
- case CAD
- find some good right angle female pin headers
